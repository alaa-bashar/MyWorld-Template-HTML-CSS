<h1>MyWorld Template</h1>

<h2>Responsive Template using HTML & CSS</h2>
To strength my skills in CSS and cover most of it's topics,
I recoded from scratch this template (which was uploaded for educational purposes on ELZERO ACADEMY website).

<h3>The origin code for the website is sort of legacy code so this is the changes I have made:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Semantic HTML.</li>
  <li>Responsive design that matches sizes for modern devices.</li>
  <li>Fixing some bugs in the old layout.</li>
  <li>Following Clean Coding laws for readability and easier maintenance process.</li>
  <li>Pure HTML and CSS.</li>
</ol>
