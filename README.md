<h1>MyWorld Template</h1>

<h2>Responsive Template using HTML & CSS</h2>
To strengthen my skills in CSS and cover most of its topics,
I recoded from scratch this template (which was uploaded for educational purposes on the ELZERO ACADEMY website).

<h3>The original code for the website is a sort of legacy code so these are the changes I have made:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Semantic HTML.</li>
  <li>Responsive design that matches sizes for modern devices.</li>
  <li>Fixing some bugs in the old layout.</li>
  <li>Following Clean Coding rules for more readability and easier maintenance process.</li>
  <li>Pure HTML and CSS.</li>
</ol>
